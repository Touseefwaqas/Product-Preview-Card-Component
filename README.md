## Things that I Learned
This project was a basic responsive project, but there were some subtle things that I learned and discovered. 

Starting off, I recognized it myself that how to change only 1, 2 and 3 borders (corners) of an image or a div, default way of using the border-radius property would set all the cover rounded but you can also set what corners you want to round.

Secondly, I discovered a new tag, <del></del>, it's basically used to represent text in this way => <s>Effect of Del Tag</s>. It was a new thing for me that I learned by researching on my own.

Thirdy, I learned that how to import fonts from files, I used to get the fonts from google fonts, just copying the URL but this time I also used the file which was a .ttf file.

Lastly, while making it responsive, I learned how to change the content or src of image on the basis of screen size using media query.
